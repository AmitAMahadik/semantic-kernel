# Agent :> I understand that you were charged twice for your subscription last month, and I'm here to assist you with resolving this issue. Hereâ€™s what we need to do next:

# 1. **Billing Inquiry**:
#    - Please provide the email address or account number associated with your subscription, the date(s) of the charges, and the amount charged. This will allow the billing team to investigate the discrepancy in the charges.

# 2. **Refund Process**:
#    - For the refund, please confirm your subscription type and the email address associated with your account.
#    - Provide the dates and transaction IDs for the charges you believe were duplicated.

# Once we have these details, we will be able to:

# - Check your billing history for any discrepancies.
# - Confirm any duplicate charges.
# - Initiate a refund for the duplicate payment if it qualifies. The refund process usually takes 5-10 business days after approval.

# Please provide the necessary details so we can proceed with resolving this issue for you.
